# Object_Detection_Sample
HOG + Linear SVM detector gives us the first impression is for pedestrian detection, but in fact they can be used for the detection of any target object. Today I would like to share with you the use of HOG + Linear SVM detector to detect tires in the conveyor belt, and LBP + SVM on the tire classification.
